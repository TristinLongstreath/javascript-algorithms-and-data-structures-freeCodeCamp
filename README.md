# JS Algorithms and Data Structures
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a nonprofit organization helping thousands of people learn to code for free. This respository captures my personal solutions to the js algorithms and data structures projects.

# Projects
These projects are made for the freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. The objective was to use JS in order to build five different projects to test the skills learned throughout the curriculm. To find further information on the projects, they are provided below.
